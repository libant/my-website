Everyday, I work with data, which happens to be my greatest passion. I ultimately plan to make a career out of it, whether it is data science, data analysis, or more.\nBeyond data, I’m interested in music, film, and fashion. Each of these serves as a wellspring of inspiration for me, offering avenues for self-expression and creativity that continually evolve with time.\nYou can email me at liban.timir@mail.utoronto.ca"
